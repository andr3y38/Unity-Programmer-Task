# Game System Overview & Interview Reflection

## Introduction
During the interview, I presented a game system I designed and developed from scratch. The core mechanics revolve around a quest indicator, coin collection, a shop, and an inventory system. The quest indicator, animated by me, guides players at the outset. Players then collect coins that respawn approximately every 7 seconds, accompanied by sound effects and a particle system to enhance the feedback loop. Upon reaching the map's end, a merchant enables the shop interface with a screen button, contrasting with the inventory access assigned to the 'I' key.

## Thought Process
My approach aimed to demonstrate a broad range of skills: animation, UI/UX design, sound integration, and game mechanics scripting. I carefully considered player engagement, ensuring interactive elements like coin collection were rewarding. The dual method of accessing game features (shop via button, inventory via keypress) was a deliberate choice to showcase flexibility in input handling and to invite feedback on preferred user interactions.

## System Features
- **Quest Indicator**: Custom-animated to guide players, setting the adventure's tone.
- **Coin Collection**: Coins respawn with sound and visuals, promoting continuous exploration.
- **Merchant & Shop**: A pivotal interaction point, allowing for gear customization.
- **Inventory Management**: Accessible via 'I' key, enabling gear review and management.
- **Purchase & Equip Mechanics**: Items bought appear in inventory, where they can then be equipped. I also set up player animation from sprites with skin equipped / unequipped. Selling is possible but requires the item to be unequipped, offering back half the purchase price.

## Personal Assessment
Reflecting on my performance, I believe the project was a concise yet effective showcase of my capabilities. Implementing the MVC pattern and the secondary unlockable item illustrated my attention to scalability and design patterns. While the project was straightforward, I think it effectively demonstrated my technical skills and creative thinking. The feedback on input methods will be invaluable for refining the user experience in future projects.

Overall, I assess my performance positively, with room for growth in areas such as dynamic content generation and further enhancing player feedback mechanisms.
